# Algorithmic-Trading-Bot
Algorithmic trading uses algorithms that follow a trend and define a set of instructions to perform a trade. The trade can generate revenue at an inhuman and enhanced speed and frequency. The characterized sets of trading guidelines that are passed on to the program are reliant upon timing, value, amount, or any mathematical model. Aside from profitable openings for the trader, algo-trading renders the market more liquid and trading more precise by precluding the effect of human feelings on trading.

# Objectives:
The global algorithmic trading market is expected to grow significantly between 2018 and 2026. Our project aims to further this revolution in the markets of tomorrow by providing an effective and efficient solution to overcome the drawbacks faced due to manual trading like :-
Trades are executed at the best possible prices.
Trade request situation is instant and precise (there is a high possibility of execution at the ideal levels).
Trades are coordinated effectively and immediately to keep away from huge value changes.
Reduced exchange costs.

# Implementation : 
Below is the implementation of our BOT.

Step 1: The User Registers by connecting their Trading account with the BOT. Then Login via username and Password.

Step 2: Portfolio page which displays Live Market Statistics, Bot Trade History, Account Details, Wallet, and Revenue opens.

Step 3: On the Portfolio page, the user will ‘Enable the Bot’. Enter Trading strategy, Stock names the user wants to trade in, Entry and Exit Points, Stop Loss value, and Strategy specific parameters (Eg: Moving Averages). Then Run the BOT.

Step 4: The BOT will constantly fetch and check the Live Market Scenario, current Open Positions, and User Wallet and Profit/Loss parameters to validate if a position can be taken for a stock in the market and decide what kind of trade is to be done. The BOT automatically calculates a number of shares to trade in keeping in mind the Targeted Profit, Stop Loss, Entry/Exit Points as well as preserving Wallet.

Step 5: The BOT will perform Automated Trading as per the Strategy and parameters set by the user and validating with the market to get Enhanced Performance and Revenue as compared to Manual Trading. The BOT will continue to do so until The Market Closes OR Exit POints/Stop Loss is reached OR The user sends a signal to stop. 

Step 6: After Each action taken by BOT or as an alert system, instant Email Notifications sent to the user.

For our Machine Learning model, we have chosen Random Forest Regressor which shows an Accuracy Score of 0.96 for our BOT.  The Random Forest Regressor is integrated with Python implemented Financial Strategies like Single Moving Average, Crossover Moving Average, Multiple Data, Gold Cross and Donchian Strategies.

The ALgorithmic Trading BOT allows the user to do –

Live Trading 
Paper Trading (Live Simulation Trading)
Back-Testing of Strategies (See how effective your trading strategy is and the Bot’s on Historical data)

# Conclusion : 
Algorithmic trading Bot not only provides Security, Cost, and Speed but is also a revolutionary technology for the future financial markets and economy.
Algorithmic Trading Bot makes it easier for both new traders as well as established ones in getting profitable outcomes with minimized effort, time, and loss.
The integration of Financial Knowledge with Machine Learning is a demand of future Trading and enhances both Performance and Revenue.
